<p>Task connectors effectively allow you to be able to add connectors to generate emails, text messages or REST calls based on events occurring on a Task. e.g. if the assigned user is changed, the status updates or if the Task becomes overdue. You define these connectors on Task Templates, thus allowing different types of jobs to have different connector configurations.</p><h3 id="SettingupTaskConnectors-CreatingTaskConnectors"><strong>Creating Task Connectors</strong></h3><p>Go to the Tasks main menu item, then jump to the &quot;templates&quot; page via the  navigation bar.</p><p>You should see a list of your existing Task Templates displayed. If you don't have any Templates, then add a new template by clicking on the <strong>ADD NEW</strong> button. This starts the task template wizard.
