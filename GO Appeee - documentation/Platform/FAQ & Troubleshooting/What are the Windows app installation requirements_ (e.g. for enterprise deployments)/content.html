<p>The Windows app requires Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8 or Windows 10. We recommend using Windows 10 with the latest operating system updates installed.</p><p>The app requires a minimum of .NET Framework 4.7.2, which is generally already installed with any of the supported Windows versions listed above, provided they have been kept up to date via Windows Update.  <br/>If your installation does not have this .NET version (or if you're unsure), then <a href="/wiki/spaces/GSD/pages/26522780413/How+do+I+check+and+or+install+.NET+Framework+for+my+Windows+app" data-linked-resource-id="26522780413" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">follow our helpful guide</a>.</p><p>Our Windows app installer does not require Administrator level permissions and provides a simple, wizard-less installation experience. The app is installed within the currently logged-in user's working directory.</p><p>Aside from the ability to write the current user's registry - which any user that can install apps should already have - there are no other installation requirements.</p><p>While not an installation requirement, if you are planning on capturing photos with your Windows device, then you should purchase hardware that includes a camera - most Windows laptops and Surface devices include this.</p><h3 id="WhataretheWindowsappinstallationrequirements?(e.g.forenterprisedeployments)-AdditionalInfoforEnterpriseDeployments"><strong>Additional Info for Enterprise Deployments</strong></h3><p>When considering deployments through tools like Microsoft System Center (SCCM), we recommend using the MSI installer for the latest app version.</p><p>Our app-build process generates an MSI file specifically for installation via Group Policy. This MSI <strong>isn't a general-purpose installer</strong>. This means that once you run the MSI, the application .exe file is only executed (i.e. installed) on next Windows login by the user.</p><p>The latest MSI can be gained by adding &quot;<strong>?msi=true</strong>&quot; to the end of our standard Windows app download link. e.g. <a href="https://web.appeee.nl/Files/WinApp/Appeee?msi=true" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>https://web.appeee.nl/Files/WinApp/Appeee?msi=true</u></a></p><p>The app is designed to operate with no UAC requests. It is installed within the local logged-in Windows user's AppData directory - i.e. %LocalAppData%\AppCode</p><p>You should ensure that your Windows policies and SCCM configuration allow the app to read and write data and folders within the %LocalAppData% directory, as well as having access to local user registry. If not, it is likely that installations and subsequent automatic app updates will have issues.</p><p>The underlying Windows app update functionality uses the industry-standard <a href="https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/blob/develop/docs/faq.md" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Squirrel.Windows</a> installer.<br/>For more information, we suggest you review the Wiki and other information available on the Squirrel.Windows Github page.</p><p>If you are using SCCM, another approach to try is the suggested process at the 3rd party link below.</p><p>This article describes SCCM installation of Microsoft Teams, however it should be equally applicable to our Windows app, since Teams uses the same Squirrel.Windows updater library.  <br/>Simply replace all Teams mentions with our app code/name:<br/><a href="https://enterinit.com/guide-deploying-microsoft-teams-client-with-sccm/" data-card-appearance="inline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://enterinit.com/guide-deploying-microsoft-teams-client-with-sccm/</a> </p>
