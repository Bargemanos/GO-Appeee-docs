<p>Currently our Map screens require that you provide geo coordinates in order to show as pins on a map. So unfortunately, addresses will not work.</p><p>The good news is that you can perform bulk geo-coding of addresses through various online services. You can look into using our own Geocoding API: <a href="https://www.geodan.com/geodanmaps-for-developers/geosearch-examples/" data-card-appearance="inline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.geodan.com/geodanmaps-for-developers/geosearch-examples/</a> </p><p>Once you've converted your addresses into geo coordinates, then you can upload those into our system and get your mapping screen up and running :)</p>
