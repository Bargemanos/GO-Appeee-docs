<p><strong>1. Use one of our existing Connectors</strong></p><p>Generally you can pull data into the platform using a Data Source Connector, while you can push data to another system using a Form Connector. We offer a number of pre-built Connectors for systems like Google Drive and Spreadsheets, external web services and emails, with others coming soon (DropBox, SkyDrive and Box to name a few). To learn more about Connectors, see the Connectors documentation on this site.</p><p><strong>2. Use our powerful Integration API</strong></p><p>We offer a comprehensive API that supports JSON and XML formats over a RESTful interface. The API is fully documented, but you will need someone with programming skills to make sense of it.</p><p>Contact us to get access to the API documentation and for any integration support needs. Note: We also offer a Professional Services Team that can build integrations for you on demand.</p>
