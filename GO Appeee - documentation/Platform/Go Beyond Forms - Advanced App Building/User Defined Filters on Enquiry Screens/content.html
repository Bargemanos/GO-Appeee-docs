Tapping on the icon will take the user into a new app screen that lets them add up to 3 custom filters which will then be applied to the data. Filters are now also “sticky” in that they are remembered by the app on subsequent screen opens.</p><p>The display of the filtering input fields is also dynamic based on the data type of the column as setup in your Data Source -&gt; Rows page on the secure website. This way the app will ensure that the correct data type is entered by the user.</p><p>If you want to display a specific set of filter option for a column (as opposed to the user typing in their search text), then use the &quot;Referring Data Source&quot; option found in the Advanced Column Properties dialog of the Data Source -&gt; Rows page on the secure website.</p><p>To learn more about this and other Advanced Column Properties, see our dedicated support article in the same section of our documentation as this article. </p>
