<p>The apps you build will have a set of standard / default Screens included by default. These being:</p><ul><li><p>Settings screen (for changing password, forcing sync, logging out)</p></li><li><p>Saved Entries screen (list of in-progress/saved Form entries)</p></li><li><p>Tasks screens (list of Tasks, Task details etc)</p></li></ul><p>You can replace these Screens in part or full by using a combination of our Listing/Mapping screen types along with one of the built-in &quot;App Data Sources&quot; we provide. Â For more on these built-in Data Sources, see our Data Sources section in the documentation.</p><p><strong>Building Your Own &quot;Saved Entries&quot; Screen</strong></p><p>Lets say you have an existing Listing screen which allows a user to launch into a pre-filled Form entry when they tap on a row in the list. That will work fine, however if they save in-progress entries then they will need a way to get back to that list of saved Form entries.</p><p>So you'll need to link them to another Screen which displays this listing.</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Add a seperate Listing Screen that shows the list of saved entries. This new Screen will be launched from your existing Listing screen, say via a button you add to the title bar.</p></li><li><p>The new Listing screen will need to:</p></li></ol><ul><li><p>Be linked to the built-in app Data Source named &quot;App: Entry Drafts&quot;.<br/>Every account includes this special built-in Data Source (plus some others).</p></li><li><p>Have an Interaction set on the rows as follows:<br/>- Type: Open Entry<br/>- Parameter: {{this[0]}}</p></li><li><p>Note that you can also filter the Data Source if you want to only show entries for Forms of a certain type.<br/>If you go to the Rows page of the App: Entry Drafts data source, you'll see the columns available to use in filtering.</p></li></ul><p>This way, the new Listing screen will show all saved/in-progress entries as rows in the Listing screen. When the user taps on a row, the app will open the chosen entry, using the entry's unique identifier (column 0).</p><p />
