<p>The NFC field type allows you to build Form screens that can read and write NFC tags using Android devices. Apple provides NFC support on IOS devices for reading only.</p><p>The best way is to experiment with the NFC field is by using inexpensive NFC stickers (also called tags). You can purchase these online, just run an internet search for the term &quot;NFC Stickers&quot;. NTAG213 tags in particular have proven very compatible with our Android NFC implementation.</p><p>Please be aware that the NFC standard has several variants, particularly around encryption.  <br/>We do not currently support encrypted NFC tags and have no plans to do so at this time.<br/>Always first purchase one or two sample tags and test these with your target devices and app before purchasing in bulk.  This will save you money if your tags do not prove to be compatible with our NFC implementation.</p><p>Please also note that<strong> to be able to use NFC tags with the app they need to be pre-formatted using the NDEF format. </strong>Considering suppliers provide tags either empty or pre-formatted, we recommend that you confirm with your potential supplier whether or not they can pre-format the tags for you using NDEF.</p><p>There are two fairly self-explanatory operations you can perform against a blank/new NFC tag/sticker:</p><ul><li><p>Read values from the tag</p></li><li><p>Write value to the tag (if the tag permits)</p></li></ul><p>When working with new/blank tags, you must specify a MIME type which the app will use for read/write operations on that NFC field. <br/>e.g <strong>application/vnd.nameofyourapp</strong> - where nameofyourapp is any unique name you wish, without spaces. You set the MIME type via the &quot;Read/Write MIME Type&quot; property found on the NFC field's properties in the Form designer.</p><p>Once a MIME type is set, then when you run up the app, you will see a Read button appear on the NFC field. If you hit the Read button and then tap your device to the NFC tag/sticker, the value stored against the given MIME type record will be set as the answer of the NFC field. Should you have any subsequent Form fields that have formulae depending on the NFC field's value, then those will be triggered by the read operation.</p><p>When it comes to writing values to the NFC tag, this is controlled via the &quot;Write Value&quot; property found on the NFC field in the Form designer. <strong>You must specify a formula which gives a text/string result</strong> in this property. i.e. a simple form field reference such as {{myfield}} will not work as a Write Value, you need to use the field in a formula function such as CONCAT().</p><p>The formula result will be written to the MIME type record on the tag via a Write button that appears on the app when a write formula is specified.<br/>e.g. you could specify CONCAT(USERLASTNAME(), ', ', USERFIRSTNAME()) as the Write Value formula.</p>
