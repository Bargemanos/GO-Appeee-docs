<p>Our platform allows you to export Data in the layouts you want by using Microsoft Word templates. If you already have Word documents that you have been printing out to use as data capture Forms, this means that with a few minor changes you can reuse these as data templates.</p><p>This functionality works similarly to a Microsoft Word "mail merge" in that the system produces output based upon pre-formatted templates.   The template contains the static (non-changing) text, images and formatting wanted in the final output.  <br/>It also includes <strong>placeholders</strong> where Form entry answers will go. </p><p>For example, imagine you have an Inspection Form and you want to export the Inspection Data captured on the app as a standard letter. You could create a Word template that sets out the standard text of the letter along with placeholders for where various Inspection answers should go. </p><p><em>Want to jump straight into the deep end?

If you already have Word/Excel files that you have been printing to use as data capture Forms, these can easily be reused as a template.</p></li><li><p>Go through your template and insert <em><strong>placeholders</strong></em> wherever you want the system to insert answers from data entries of your chosen Form.Placeholders are entered using the unique data name of the Form field, wrapped in curly braces â€“ e.g. <strong>{{dataname}}</strong><br/>So for example if your Form has a field with data name of "LastName", then you can instruct the system to inject the answer for this field wherever the placeholder {{LastName}} appears.<br/>Any formatting (font, color, highlighting, size etc) that you apply to the placeholder will be honoured by the system and applied to the answer value inserted.Note that for Excel templates, we only support one placeholder per cell and the cell should not contain any other text around the placeholder.</p></li><li><p>Once you have inserted all the placeholders needed, upload the template file to your Form screen.<br/>There are two places where you can add a template to a Form:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Form Level</p><p>If you add a template at this level, you are instructing the system to use this template as the default whenever a PDF is generated.</p><p>Upload your template using the "Word Template" field found in your Form's Settings page.</p></li><li><p>Connector Level</p></li><li><p>This is a template that is specific to one or more Connectors, but should not be used as a default.Upload your template using the "add data template" link found on appropriate Connectors in your Form's Connectors page.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>NOTE: Uploading a template also makes new export options available on the Data area.</p><h2 id="WordTemplates-TestingYourTemplates"><strong>Testing Your Templates</strong></h2><p>Assuming you have at least one existing Form entry for your Form, you can test your templates fairly easily by using the Data area.</p><p>In the Data page, search entries against your Form and the version onto which you uploaded your template. Once you have some Data results, hover over a row and click the Export option to get an instant look at your template output :)</p><h2 id="WordTemplates-Troubleshooting/CommonIssues"><strong>Troubleshooting / Common Issues</strong></h2><p><em><strong>Your generated docx output does not open in Word, giving errors such as "unreadable content" or "file is corrupt and cannot be opened"</strong></em></p><p>The issue is down to the docx template being used in your Word data template.</p><p>Usually this means that your Word doc is linked under the hood to an inaccessible docx file (usually located on your personal PC or on a network drive).</p><p>Now this docx file is obviously not available to the GO Appeee platform when it generates the file and naturally is not found when you open the Word output file on another machine.</p><p>What you need to do is clear the docx template of your Word file, which will let the Word file default to the standard "Normal" docx template.</p><p>Follow the steps below to clear the problem docx template:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><a href="http://wordribbon.tips.net/T006746_Displaying_the_Developer_Tab.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Display the Developer tab</a> in the Word ribbon, and navigate to the Developer tab.</p></li><li><p>Click the Document Template tool.
