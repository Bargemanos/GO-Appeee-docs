<p>If you have data source rows that you wish to make continuously available to the app, the best way is to make use of
    Sync’s Hosted GET support.</p>
<p>You need to create your desired data source tables in the <strong>SyncData</strong> database, naming the tables by
    the External Id you have assigned to the matching Data Source in our platform. Once set up, the app will directly
    request rows from the <strong>SyncData</strong> database table, bypassing the need to have rows on our platform
    altogether.</p>
<p>Within the Sync application, a data source REST API is exposed with a single on GET function which accepts a data
    source request and generates a response containing the specified SyncData database tables, where external id is the
    table name. This API is accessible on the configured https://{IP Address/Domain Name}/api/v2/datasources.</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of this, add a Hosted GET connector within the Platform for each data source as follows:
</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>
        <p>Login to the Platform</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Navigate to Connected Data -&gt; Data Sources and click the settings link on the target data source.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Ensure that you have set the External Id field with a value – this MUST match the name of the table you’ve
            created in the SyncData database.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Mouse over Add Connector and select Hosted GET</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Enter the connector details as per the screenshot below (enter your own Sync installation’s data sources
            target URL) and click Save.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>If you are setting up many data sources with Hosted GET connectors, then you may want to set the Global Hosted GET
    URL found in the Menu -&gt; Organisation Setup page. Set this to be the Sync API endpoint and then on all Hosted GET
    connectors, instead of filling in the “Target GET URL” rather just to the “Use Global Hosted GET URL” option.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTES</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Each platform Data Source External Id <strong>must</strong> <strong>match</strong> that of the SyncData
            table’s name.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Columns in the data source must follow the <strong>same order</strong> as the columns in the related table.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
