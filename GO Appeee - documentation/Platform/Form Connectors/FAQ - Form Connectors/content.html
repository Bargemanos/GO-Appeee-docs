<p><strong>Is it possible to connect a form to an Excel spreadsheet on Google Drive, One Drive or Dropbox so that each time a form is filled out on the device, it adds a line to the same spreadsheet?</strong></p><p>Our Google Spreadsheet connector currently supports this scenario, in that we append rows to the same Google Spreadsheet. When you create new versions of your form, we continue to append rows to the same worksheet, just adding missing columns as needed.</p><p>For the Excel side on Dropbox, Google Drive etc, we do not currently support appending rows. This is because if we did so, we would have to download the file each time first in order to append the row, then upload it back to the storage location. When there are many entries coming in - and often concurrently - this rapidly becomes very problematic.</p><p>Google Spreadsheet does not have this problem, because we are able to add rows through a programming interface (called an API) instead of downloading the spreadsheet each time.</p><p>Microsoft is said to be launching new APIs in the future that will match Google Spreadsheet, when/if this happens we will look to add appending support for Excel Online.</p>
