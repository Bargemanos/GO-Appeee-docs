<p>When it comes to validating user answers, you have the following standard options:</p><ul><li><p>Required - forces the user to provide *something* as an answer</p></li><li><p>Date/Number Range - allows you to easily set lower &amp; upper limits for date and number answers</p></li><li><p>Answer Format - found on Text field types only, this enforces basic formatting requirements on the answer value</p></li></ul><p>However, imagine if your Form involved capturing a job code into a text field. The user should always enter a known job code, but the truth is that they can put in any textual value. We know that a valid job code looks like &quot;JOB-XXXX&quot; where the XXXXs are a number value.</p><p>Wouldn't it be cool if we could validate their input to ensure the value at least contains the text &quot;JOB-&quot;?</p><p>This is when you should use the <strong>Custom Validation </strong>property.</p><p>Custom Validation is a general purpose property that lets you define a form formula to check whether an answer value is valid. A true outcome means that the field is valid and the user can proceed. False means that the field is not valid and the user needs to provide a valid answer.</p><p>Custom Validation gives you the freedom to define pretty much any logic to validate an answer value<em>.</em></p><p><em>IMPORTANT NOTE: Custom validation only works when there is a value entered in the field. To force the user to input a value, use the Required property together with Custom Validation.</em></p><p /><p>Let's go through the steps needed to provide some custom validation for the Job Code scenario described above.</p><p>Open up a new or existing Form in the Form Designer, and perform the following steps:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Add a text field to your Form, with Title of &quot;Job Code&quot; and Data Name of &quot;jobCode&quot;.</p></li><li><p>Find the Custom Validation property on this Job Code field.  <br/>It's located at the bottom of the properties list, in the Advanced section.</p></li><li><p>Now we need to create a formula that will give a True or False result.<br/>When the formula result is True, the field will be considered valid.<br/>When the result is False, the field will be invalid.<br/><br/>Enter the following formula into the Custom Validation property:<br/><strong>string-length({{jobCode}}) = 8 and substr({{jobCode}}, 0, 4) = 'JOB-'</strong><br/><br/>Woah that's a complicated formula!<br/>Lets break it down:</p><ul><li><p><strong>string-length({{jobCode}}) = 8</strong><br/>First we want to ensure that the answer is exactly 8 characters long.<br/>Remember we expect job codes to be entered in the fixed format &quot;JOB-XXXX&quot; - this is a total of 8 characters long.</p></li><li><p><strong>substr({{jobCode}}, 0, 4) = 'JOB-'</strong><br/>Next we want to ensure that the job code provided starts with the prefix &quot;JOB-&quot;.<br/>So we use substr() to grab the first 4 characters of the answer and check if it does indeed match the required prefix.</p></li><li><p>We use the <strong>and</strong> logic operator to ensure that both the above conditions must be met in order to return a TRUE result.<br/><br/>To understand more about how to create a formula, see the <a href="/wiki/spaces/GSD/pages/26522781077/Creating+a+Formula" data-linked-resource-id="26522781077" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">Creating a Formula</a> help page.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Find the  <strong>Invalid Message</strong> property on the new field.  <br/>It's located near the top of the Advanced section.</p></li></ol><p>By default the app will show a generic &quot;Job Code is invalid&quot; message to the user if the Custom Validation property result is false. Let's rather show a more custom message. So set the Invalid Message property to something like &quot;You must provide a valid Job Code in the format JOB-XXXX&quot;. This way the user understands how they must fill out the Job Code field.</p><p>All done!</p><p>Save your Form and Test it on your device to see your Custom Validation in action :)</p><p />
