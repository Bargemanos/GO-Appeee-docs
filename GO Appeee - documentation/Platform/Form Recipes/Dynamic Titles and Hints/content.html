<p>Sometimes you may want your field's Title or Hint text to dynamically include a value from a previous field.</p><p>This is useful in cases where the answer to one question sets the context for the fields that follow. For example, say you have a Choices field that asks &quot;What is the type of Incident?&quot;. Depending on what the user selects, we want to include the incident type in the Title Text of the fields that come next.</p><p>The Text Builder function - found on the Title Text and Hint Text field properties - comes in handy for these situations.</p><p>Lets assume we have a field: &quot;What is the type of Incident?&quot; - a Choices field with Data Name incidentType, having the answer options: Spill, Injury, Equipment</p><ol><li><p>We add a new Text field to the Form, with Data Name of incidentDescription.</p></li><li><p>On this new field, find the Title Text property.<br/>If you hover your mouse over the property, or click into the property, you will see a hammer icon appear. Click the hammer icon.</p></li><li><p>You are now in the Text Builder.</p></li><li><p>This lets you build up a dynamic text value for display in the Title Text property.<br/>Note that you have a drop down of all available fields that will insert the selected field into your formula.</p></li><li><p>Enter the following:<br/><strong>Please describe the {{incidentType}}</strong></p></li><li><p>Click the Apply button to set this into your field.</p></li></ol><p>Awesome, we now have a dynamic Title that will dynamically display the type of incident selected.<br/>For example if the user selects &quot;Injury&quot; in the incidentType field, then the description field Title will be &quot;Please describe the Injury&quot;.</p><p>That's all there is to it, you now know how to make dynamic Titles and Hints!</p><p>If you would like to try the above example out for yourself, download the attached CSV file. Then create a new Form and in the Form designer, use the &quot;Import Fields&quot; button to upload the CSV. This will give you the fully working example from above to try out and learn from :)</p><p class="media-group"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper conf-macro output-inline" data-hasbody="false" data-macro-name="view-file" data-macro-id="2c4038b6-abf4-4f4b-976e-9bd43a354d4a"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="/wiki/download/attachments/26522783097/DynamicTitleExample.csv?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1689148752654&amp;cacheVersion=1&amp;api=v2" data-nice-type="null" data-file-src="/wiki/download/attachments/26522783097/DynamicTitleExample.csv?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1689148752654&amp;cacheVersion=1&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="26522783109" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="26522783097" data-linked-resource-default-alias="DynamicTitleExample.csv" data-mime-type="text/csv" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-media-id="a47ff874-552d-4f5f-a0a6-ad367593dde5" data-media-type="file"><img src="../../../../assets/Form Recipes/Dynamic Titles and Hints/DynamicTitleExample.csv" height="250" /></a></span></p><p />
