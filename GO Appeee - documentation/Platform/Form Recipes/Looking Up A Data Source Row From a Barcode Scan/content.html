<p>A common scenario that occurs in mobile business is the need to scan a barcode to look up information about the item the bar code is affixed to.</p><p>Effectively one wants a Form that should capture the barcode and retrieve a row from Data Source.</p><p>The way to do this is to use a Choices field along with a Data Source.</p><h3 id="LookingUpADataSourceRowFromaBarcodeScan-ScanningBarcodesIntoaChoicesField"><strong>Scanning Barcodes Into a Choices Field</strong></h3><p>First of all, the Data Source needs to contain the various pieces of information for each bar coded item you expect to scan for.</p><p>For example, lets call it the &quot;Equipment&quot; data source, where it might look something like:</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-layout="default" data-local-id="bffce281-e4bd-4d09-ae55-56bffa7b345d" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 170.0px;"/><col style="width: 170.0px;"/><col style="width: 170.0px;"/><col style="width: 170.0px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>BARCODE</strong></p></th><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>EQUIPMENT NAME</strong></p></th><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>CONTACT PERSON</strong></p></th><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>LAST SERVICED</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>123456</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Premier Chair</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>John Smith</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>23-09-2015</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>654321</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Standard Table</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Mike Doe</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>15-11-2014</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The first column in your Data Source MUST contain the actual barcode values - i.e. the number or text that will be scanned in by the app.</p><p>With retail barcodes, the numbers are usually printed under the barcode lines.<br/></p><p>Now in your Form design, you would add a Choices field with:</p><ul><li><p>Data name of say &quot;equipmentChoice&quot;</p></li><li><p>Data Source to be the &quot;Equipment&quot; one set up previously above</p></li><li><p>Tick the &quot;Allow Barcode Lookup&quot; option</p></li></ul><p /><p>Save your design, and hit the TEST button to put the Form into Test mode for you to try out.</p><p>Once in Test mode, every time you save changes to the Form design, you will be able to test these on the device without having to Publish each time.</p><p>Next, run the Form on your device, first waiting for the &quot;Sync Complete&quot; message to confirm the new design has been downloaded.</p><p>In the Form, you should notice that there is a Barcode button on the &quot;equipmentChoice&quot; Choices field. Hit the button and scan a barcode with the device camera. Assuming the code matches one of the rows in your Equipment data source, the app should display that row as selected.</p><h3 id="LookingUpADataSourceRowFromaBarcodeScan-PopulatingOtherFieldsBasedOnABarcodeScan"><strong>Populating Other Fields Based On A Barcode Scan</strong></h3><p>In terms of populating other fields based on the row selected in your &quot;equipmentChoice&quot; field, this is done back in the Form designer.</p><p>Go back to the designer and add a couple more fields below your &quot;equipmentChoice&quot; field. e.g. a Text field for the Equipment Name, another Text for Contact Name, and a Date Only field for the Last Serviced. Now on each of these fields, scroll down the list of properties on the right hand side until you see the &quot;Bind To Data Source Column&quot; option. On each field, choose the Equipment data source and then choose the relevant column to match the field.</p><p>If you save your design and go back to the app, first make sure to force a synchronisation to receive the design change. You can do this via &quot;Check for Updates&quot; button on the Settings screen of the app, or by simply putting the app into the background and bringing it back to the foreground via your device multi-tasking.</p><p>Once you see the &quot;Sync Complete&quot; message, open up a new entry for your Form and repeat the steps to scan a barcode and get a selected row. This time you should see that once the row is selected in the &quot;equipmentChoice&quot; field, the other fields below are populated too :-)</p>
