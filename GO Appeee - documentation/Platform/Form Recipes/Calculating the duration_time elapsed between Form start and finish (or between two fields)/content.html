<hr/><p>For some questionaire/survey type scenarios, you may wish to track the time it takes the user to fill out a Form, or maybe a section in the Form.</p><p>This is done by storing a corresponding start and end date/time value, with these values being set when the user answers the first and last questions in the target Form or section.</p><p>Once you have the start and end date/time values, you can then use a DATEDIFF() formula function to calculate the time elapsed in your desired unit of measure.</p><hr/><p><strong>Step by step guide</strong></p><p>We're going to use Hidden fields for this example since we don't want the user to see these stored values.  <br/>You can also use Text or Date/Time fields if you wanted to display the start and finish date/time values to the user.</p><p>We're also assuming you have at least two question fields - one at the start with data name of &quot;myfirstquestion&quot; and one at the end named &quot;mylastquestion&quot;.</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Add a Hidden field with data name of &quot;starttime&quot; to the start of your Form design, and a similar &quot;endtime&quot; Hidden field at the end of the Form.</p></li><li><p>On these Hidden fields, set the Dynamic Value to be as follows:<br/>starttime field: <strong>FORMAT-DATE(NOW({{myfirstquestion}}), 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')</strong><br/>endtime field: <strong>FORMAT-DATE(NOW({{mylastquestion}}), 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')</strong><br/><br/>Let's explain what the above formula is doing:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>NOW()</strong> function will return the current date/time at the time of the function being triggered</p></li><li><p>The <strong>{{dataname}}</strong> parameter means that the NOW function will be triggered whenever an answer is set into the named field.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>FORMAT_DATE() </strong>function is needed because Hidden fields store text - not date - values.<br/>So if you didn't do this, you would likely lose the time portion of the NOW value.</p></li><li><p>The formatting parameter ensures the date/time is captured as text like: &quot;2016-10-21 14:10:55&quot;<br/><br/>Also, a worthy mention is that most .NET Format strings/specifiers can work with our <strong>FORMAT-DATE()</strong> formula function for added customization of captured Dates and Times. Here is a link to .NET Format strings that may be of interest: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings" data-card-appearance="inline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings</a> <br/></p></li></ul></li><li><p>The final piece to this solution is to add one more field (Hidden, Text or Number) which has a Dynamic Value formula to calculate the difference between the finish and start date/time values.</p></li><li><p>This field's formula would be :</p></li></ol><p><strong>DATEDIFF(({{starthidden}}), {{finishhidden}}, 'SS')</strong></p><p>This will give you the difference in seconds between the start and end times. You can of course then divide this value by 60 as desired to get a minute value. If you wish to get the difference in minutes, hours etc, simply change the 'SS' parameter as needed.</p><hr/><p><strong>Date/Time Difference Example App</strong></p><p>To help you get acquainted with FORMAT-DATE(), DATEDIFF() and NOW() concepts, we've created an example app which we've published to our Examples Catalog.</p><p>The Example App consists of 4 pages with various fields to achieve the capturing/displaying of data in different ways.</p><p>► Page 1 - Introduction + Capture Start time of form<br/>► Page 2 - Date Difference<br/>► Page 3 - Time Difference<br/>► Page 4 - Capture End time of form + Summary</p><p>Using the above mentioned formula to calculate date/time differences, the form demonstrates how to achieve similar functionality with other forms you create.<br/><a href="/wiki/spaces/GSD/pages/26522783292/Formula+Cheat+Sheet" data-linked-resource-id="26522783292" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">Learn more about our date/time and data conversion formulas in our Formula Cheat Sheet</a></p><p>To install the Date/Time Difference Example App: <br/><a href="http://web.appeee.nl/Catalog?launch=Date/Time%20Difference%20Example%20App" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://web.appeee.nl/Catalog?launch=Date/Time Difference Example App</a></p><p />
