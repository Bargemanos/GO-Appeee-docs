<p>Sometimes you may want to store values on the device to reuse on the same Screen or in multiple Screens.</p><p>For example, say you have a common field in several Form Screens that the user has to select every time - e.g. a project, client or job number. If the user tends to select the same value every time, then you should consider storing this in a Global Value.</p><p>Global Values let you specify that a Form field should get its default value from a new key/value store that exists on the device. The functionality works like the name says - its a globally accessible storage across all Screens on a specific device.</p><p>For now only the Form screens can leverage this, but we will be introducing Global Values to other screen types soon.</p><p>Lets consider an example:</p><p>Say you have a screen that has a Project field and a Site field. The Project must be chosen first from the list of available projects, and this then will filter the Site field with the available sites for that project.</p><ol><li><p>On your Project field, set the &quot;Bind to Global Value&quot; property to be a name of your choice - e.g. &quot;defaultProject&quot;.</p></li><li><p>On your Site field, set the &quot;Bind to Global Value&quot; property to be a different name of your choice - e.g. &quot;defaultSite&quot;.</p></li><li><p>Save and set the Form into Test or Published mode.</p></li></ol><p>When an entry for this Form is uploaded, the app will now automatically save the answer for Project into the Global Values key of &quot;defaultProject&quot;, and similarly it will do the same for &quot;defaultSite&quot;. The app has effectively created a local dictionary/lookup that looks like:</p><p>defaultProject = &quot;Last project the user selected&quot;<br/>defaultSite = &quot;Last site the user selected&quot;</p><p>When the user next opens your Form, these Global Values will loaded and defaulted into the respective Project and Site fields - thus effectively remembering the last selected values for those two fields.</p><p>Similarly you could now also set Project &amp; Site fields in other Forms to bind to the defaultProject &amp; defaultSite Global Values. The same behaviour as above will occur when the user opens these Forms - they will see that Project and Site is preset. This is powerful for cases where you want to have a persistent Project &amp; Site context for the user across multiple Forms.</p><h3 id="SavingEntryValuesForReuse/Defaulting(GlobalValues)-UsingGlobalValuesinaFormula"><strong>Using Global Values in a Formula</strong></h3><p>If you want to refer to a Global Value in a formula, this is also possible - simply use the <strong>GLOBALVAL('keyname')</strong> formula function.</p><p>Note that all Global Values are stored as text, so if you use GLOBALVAL() as an assignment to a Date/Time or Number field, then you will need to convert the value to the correct datatype of the target field. This is done using our TODATE() and TONUMBER() functions respectively.</p><p />
