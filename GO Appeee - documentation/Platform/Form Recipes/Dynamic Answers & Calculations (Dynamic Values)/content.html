<p>Often you may need to display some text or calculate a value in a dynamic fashion.</p><p>For example, you may want to show different text in a field based on what the user has previously answered. Or maybe you have a product order Form that should calculate the total amount to pay.</p><p>This is where the Dynamic Value property found on most form fields comes in handy.</p><p>Dynamic Value allows you to create a formula that generates or calculates a result that is assigned as the given field's answer.</p><p>So for example, imagine you have the following Form fields:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;Enter Product Name&quot; - a Text field with Data Name of productName</p></li><li><p>&quot;Enter Product Cost&quot; - a Number field with Data Name of productCost</p></li><li><p>&quot;Enter Number of Items&quot; - a Number field with Data Name of numberItems</p></li></ul><p /><ol start="1"><li><p>Add a new Hidden field to your Form, and set the Data Name to be &quot;totalIncludingTax&quot;</p></li><li><p>On this new field, find the Dynamic Value property.<br/>Its found near the bottom of the properties list, in the Advanced section.</p></li><li><p>Enter the following formula into the Dynamic Value:<br/><strong>{{productCost}} * {{numberItems}} * 1.10</strong><br/><br/>What we've done so far is add a hidden field (a field the app user will never see) which will store the result of the formula calculation. The formula is applying a 10% tax rate to the product cost amount. This is the first example of how you can use the Dynamic Value property to calculate results.<br/><br/>Now we're going to use Dynamic Value again to display a message to the app user. We want to summarise their order details using a read-only Text field.</p></li><li><p>Add a new Text field to your Form, set the Data Name to be &quot;orderSummary&quot;.</p></li><li><p>Find the Read Only property and tick the box.<br/>This will make the field readonly, so the user cannot change the displayed answer text.</p></li><li><p>Find the Dynamic Value property and enter the following formula.<br/><strong>concat('You ordered ', {{numberItems}}, ' of ', {{productName}}, '. Total (including tax) is {{totalIncludingTax}})</strong></p></li></ol><p>What we're doing with the above formula is building up dynamic text, by concatenating together pieces of text. The <strong>concat()</strong> function is used to build up the final text, and we are using the values from the various fields (the {{dataName}} bits).</p><p>See the <a href="/wiki/spaces/GSD/pages/26522781077/Creating+a+Formula" data-linked-resource-id="26522781077" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">Creating a Formula</a> page, to learn more about how a formula works.</p><p>That's it, you now know how to create dynamic values and calculations!</p><p>If you would like to try the above example out for yourself, download the attached CSV file. Then create a new Form and in the Form designer, use the &quot;Import Fields&quot; button to upload the CSV. This will give you the fully working example from above to try out and learn from :)</p><p class="media-group"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper conf-macro output-inline" data-hasbody="false" data-macro-name="view-file" data-macro-id="fa443c99-4b93-414c-bf00-5d9005e52e8c"><a class="confluence-embedded-file" href="/wiki/download/attachments/26522783076/DynamicValueExample.csv?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1689148752374&amp;cacheVersion=1&amp;api=v2" data-nice-type="null" data-file-src="/wiki/download/attachments/26522783076/DynamicValueExample.csv?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1689148752374&amp;cacheVersion=1&amp;api=v2" data-linked-resource-id="26522783090" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-container-id="26522783076" data-linked-resource-default-alias="DynamicValueExample.csv" data-mime-type="text/csv" data-has-thumbnail="true" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-media-id="3813c7dd-1477-4cbb-bf4f-26ab01f88f12" data-media-type="file"><img src="../../../../assets/Form Recipes/Dynamic Answers & Calculations (Dynamic Values)/DynamicValueExample.csv" height="250" /></a></span></p><p />
