<p>Depending on your scenario, you may want to create a list of barcodes that are scanned by the user through a Form.</p><p>One way you can do this is to have a very simple Form design that contains just a single barcode field, along with a Data Source field. The Data Source field would link an existing Data Source which will be where your barcode scans are collected into. The user would then capture a separate Form entry for each barcode, uploading each in turn and thereby creating a new row each time in the linked Data Source. See our recipe article on &quot;Creating/Updating Rows in a Data Source&quot; for details on how to bind your Barcode field to a Data Source column.</p><p>Another, faster, way is to use a repeating Page to continuously capture all barcodes until the user is ready to upload all as part on one Form entry. This requires that you use a combination of features in our platform as follows:</p><ol><li><p>In your Form design, add a Page which is set to be <strong>Repeating</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Add a Barcode field into the repeating Page.</p></li><li><p>Click on the Barcode field you just added, and in the properties list on the right, find the &quot;<strong>On Scan Action</strong>&quot;.</p></li><li><p>Choose &quot;<strong>Jump to Form Location</strong>&quot; from the Scan Action list</p></li><li><p>In the Target dropdown that reveals below, choose &quot; <strong>Add New Repeat/Row</strong>&quot; from the list.</p></li></ol><p>This way, every time a bar code is scanned, the app will store that barcode in the Barcode field, and also automatically create and move the Form display to a new repeat of the Page, ready for the next scan.</p><p>To save even more time for the user, try enabling the &quot;<strong>Show Inline</strong>&quot; option found on the Barcode field in the Form designer. This will display a live camera preview which will scan barcodes without the user needing to press the &quot;Capture Barcode&quot; button each time.</p>
