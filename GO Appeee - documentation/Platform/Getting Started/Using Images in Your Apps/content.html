<p>Our platform has a number of different ways that you can include images into screens to improve display and usability.</p><h3 id="UsingImagesinYourApps-ImagesinDataSources"><strong>Images in Data Sources</strong></h3><p>On the data source side, you can add columns to your data source that have a type of &quot;Image&quot;. This then allows you to upload images directly into the rows from the <strong>Rows</strong> page.  Alternatively you can insert web links (URLs) into the column for publicly accessible images - e.g. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d4/Mickey_Mouse.png" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d4/Mickey_Mouse.png</a>. If you are using a connector for your data source rows, then you must specify public URLs for the images.</p>

<p>Once you have images in your data source, you can set the image to display as a thumbnail whenever rows from the data source are displayed.</p><p>This is done via the <strong>Settings</strong> page for your data source. On the <strong>Settings</strong> page, select your image column from the drop-down in the thumbnail area of the <strong>Default Row Display. </strong>When a thumbnail is set on your <strong>Default Row Display</strong>, the thumbnail will appear when you use a Choices field in your form that has its Display Style property set to be List of Options.</p>

<p>In Listing screens, you can also bind your image column to the thumbnail property using the Listing screen designer.</p><p>And in Detail screens, if you bind your image column to a detail field the app will display the image at full-screen width.</p><h3 id="UsingImagesinYourApps-ImagesinFormScreens"><strong>Images in Form Screens</strong></h3><p>Another way to involve images in your app is by using the Section field type in your Form screens. This field type is a read-only display field that allows you to upload images that will appear inline in the app. Common uses for Sections include showing diagrams, lengthy formatted disclaimers and even navigation or section headings.</p><p>The Sketch field type also provides the option to upload a default background image. This comes in handy when you want to have a standard background image that you want your users to annotate - for example circling injury areas on an outline of a human body or marking spots on a floor plan.</p><p>Finally, there is also an option to capture an image from a specified URL on Media field types. This proves helpful when you want the user to trigger the image capture and display, e.g. from an IP camera.</p><p />
