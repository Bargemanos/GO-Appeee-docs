<p>One of the key features of our platform is the ability to &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pull&quot; data between the
    platform and other systems and services.</p>
<p>This enables you to build apps and functionality that features live business data. Examples of this can be jobs,
    clients, products, projects, contacts.  Having access to this data in the field can make all the difference and
    empowers dynamic line of business functions. </p>
<p>There are two key ways that you can integrate with other external systems/services: </p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Use one of our built-in <strong>Connectors </strong>and/or <strong>Full Integration API</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Create your own integration using our fully featured <strong>Company API</strong><br /></p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Pushing/PullingDataTo/FromOtherSystems-Connectors"><strong>Connectors</strong></h2>
<p>These are essentially &quot;baked in&quot; integrations that allow you to &quot;push out&quot; and pull in&quot; data
    between our platform and others. </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Pushing Data</strong><br />To &quot;push&quot; data that has been captured on the mobile app, you can
            setup Connectors on form screens. These can do everything from emailing PDFs, updating Google Spreadsheets
            all the way through to sending SMS text messages. See the &quot;connectors&quot; page available on every
            Form screen. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Pulling Data</strong><br />&quot;Pulling&quot; data is achieved by adding a Connector to a data
            source.  This will mean that your data source is refreshed regularly with changes made on the external
            system's data rows.  You can connect to a variety of services such as Google Drive, One Drive, GeoOp and
            more. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Connections  </strong><br />Depending on the connector you want to use, you may need to set up a
            Connection first.  The connection setup page is found under the &quot;Your Account&quot; menu in the secure
            website.  Once on the Connections page, click on the &quot;Add Connection&quot; menu on the right-hand side.
            You can then choose the desired platform or service that you want to connect to. You may need to go through
            an authorisation process to grant our platform access to your external account. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Pushing/PullingDataTo/FromOtherSystems-FullIntegrationAPI"><strong>Full Integration API</strong></h3>
<p>Using a REST/Hosted GET connector, to push/pull data to your web services.<br />REST based integration API makes it

    system.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="Pushing/PullingDataTo/FromOtherSystems-CompanyAPI"><strong>Company API</strong> </h2>
<p>Our company integration API allows you to put together a completely custom integration that does exactly what you
    want it to do.  This opens up many different options that may not be possible using Connectors. </p>
<p>Available to customers who offer our platform as a service to their clients and lets you create, update and retrieve
    client accounts.</p>
<p>Aimed at software developers and so you will need to ensure you have access to such personnel. We also have a small
    services team that may be able to assist if you do not have such technical staff available.  <br />You can find full
    documentation on our API under the Integration section of our documentation website.</p>
