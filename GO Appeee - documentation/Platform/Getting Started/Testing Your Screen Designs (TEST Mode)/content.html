Additionally, you would have many different Form field configurations to cater to if you do any integrations.</p><p>Thus we <strong>strongly recommend</strong> you instead use our<strong> Test mode</strong> when you are developing/testing changes to a Form design.</p><p><strong>Contents</strong></p><div class="toc-macro client-side-toc-macro  conf-macro output-block" data-headerelements="H1,H2,H3,H4,H5,H6,H7" data-hasbody="false" data-macro-name="toc" data-macro-id="f13e789f-5cb1-4de3-bc33-bdc52edfac6c" data-layout="default" data-local-id="3610d313-7fd0-487a-8136-f6285b65b62c"> </div><hr/><h2 id="TestingYourScreenDesigns(TESTMode)-TestMode">Test Mode</h2><p>Test mode allows you to test and tweak your Screen changes during the design process. Instead of continuously publishing new versions to see the changes on your device, you simply save changes in the relevant Screen designer while in Test mode and then sync these changes to your device. Make more changes and test again without having to publish a new version of the screen every time.</p><p>It's a simple and easy way to iterate on your design, figuring out formulae and other functionality you desire. </p><p>All you need to do is to hit the <strong>Manage Test </strong>button in the designer, then choose who will participate in the test.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="442" loading="lazy" src="../../../../assets/Getting Started/Testing Your Screen Designs (TEST Mode)/image-20221010-131305.png"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information conf-macro output-block" data-hasbody="true" data-macro-name="info" data-macro-id="df6d11bc-e38f-4093-9c4f-12612e86c6e8"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon"> </span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Note, that the Manage Test Option is only available on Screens that are in Draft status.</p></div></div><p>If you have a <strong>Published </strong>version, you will need to click on the <strong>New Version</strong> button.

As long as the form is in Test Mode, your testers' devices will update every time you save changes to the form design.</p><p>This makes it easy to make a change, save the design, and then jump over to your device to test it out.</p><p>The only thing you need to ensure is that an app synchronization occurs so that the changed design downloads to the device. </p><p>You can do this by simply sending the app to the background and bringing it back to the foreground.
