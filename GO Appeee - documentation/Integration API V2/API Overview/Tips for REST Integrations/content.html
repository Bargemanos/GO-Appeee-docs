<p>While we can't offer you advice in terms of how to program your web service, below are some tips on how to best configure and test your work.</p><h3 id="TipsforRESTIntegrations-Re-runningRESTconnectors"><strong>Re-running REST connectors</strong></h3><p>When testing out your web service against incoming data from our platform, you'll likely need our platform to send the same REST request over and over.<br/>Requests are generated from our platform by the REST connector's triggering event - e.g. by a new Form entry being captured.<br/>Capturing a new Form entry every time you want to test a REST request will be time-consuming, so instead, you should rather reschedule a REST connector against an existing entry.  This way you can run the same REST connector job over and over again.</p><p>To reschedule a Form entry connector:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Go to the Data area of the GO Appeee web platform and search for your target Form entry</p></li><li><p>Mouse over the target Form entry row in the Data listing, and click the &quot;logs&quot; link to show the Logs dialog.</p></li><li><p>The Logs dialog shows you the various connector jobs run for the entry, including your REST connector.  <br/>You can reschedule the REST job by mousing over the REST connector log line and clicking the &quot;reschedule&quot; link.</p></li></ol><h3 id="TipsforRESTIntegrations-UseRequestB.intoviewRESTrequestssentbyourplatform"><strong>Use </strong><a href="http://RequestB.in" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><strong>RequestB.in</strong></a><strong> to view REST requests sent by our platform</strong></h3><p>If you're not sure what exactly is being sent by our platform to your service, then a service like <a href="https://requestbin.com/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">requestbin.com</a> provides a simple, free way to see the exact data sent. RequestBin (and similar services) gives you a URL that will collect requests made to it and lets you inspect them in a human-friendly way.</p><p>The steps to set-up are simple:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Head over to <a href="http://RequestB.in" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">RequestB.in</a> and create a RequestBin.  Make sure you tick the &quot;Private&quot; checkbox to keep your data safe.</p></li><li><p>Point your REST connector at the <a href="http://RequestBin.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">RequestBin.com</a> URL and trigger your REST connector (e.g. by capturing a new Form entry or by rescheduling the connector on an existing entry)</p></li><li><p>Give the connector a minute to be run and then review the REST request information over at your private RequestBin URL.</p></li></ol><h3 id="TipsforRESTIntegrations-ShouldyouuseacustomRESTbodyornot?"><strong>Should you use a custom REST body or not?</strong></h3><p>By default, our REST connectors will send data in one of our standard answer formats.</p><p>If you want to connect a REST connector to an existing API on your systems, then you <strong>must</strong> specify a custom body on your REST connector, since our standard formats will not be compatible with your API. <br/>Custom bodies are dynamically generated by our system against a JSON/XML template that you specify. <br/>The relevant answer/data values are injected into your template by using our standard Data Template syntax; this concept works similarly to a &quot;mail merge&quot; in Word. You should definitely review our Data Templates documentation to understand how to handle concepts like repeating data. <br/>See the &quot;Outputting Data with Templates&quot; section for more. Custom bodies can take a while to get exactly right, usually through much testing, but this does provide the most flexible way to integrate with existing APIs and services.</p><p>If you are building a brand new web service from scratch, then we recommend you build your web service to work with one of our built-in answer formats. This will save you time in terms of having to design your own request format; instead, you can just work with ours immediately.</p><p>We provide three standard formats for outputting Form entry data:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;Flat&quot; - provides a flatted output of Form entry data</p></li><li><p>&quot;Rich&quot; - provides a detailed hierarchical data output</p></li><li><p>&quot;Raw&quot;- provides a minimal hierarchical output</p></li></ul><p>You can view these formats in action by choosing a format from the given dropdown on your REST connector, then testing the connector to gather the request result (e.g. using <a href="http://RequestBin.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">RequestBin.com</a> above). Another way to view these formats in action is via the API Explorer. Head over to the FormEntry/Search endpoint and use the AnswerFormat parameter to specify the desired response format.</p><h3 id="TipsforRESTIntegrations-UsingSOAPXML"><strong>Using SOAP XML</strong></h3><p>Our platform supports the use of SOAP XML in REST Connectors to POST or PUT to external APIs.</p><p>A SOAP message is an ordinary XML document containing the following elements:</p><ul><li><p>An Envelope element that identifies the XML document as a SOAP message</p></li><li><p>A Header element that contains header information</p></li><li><p>A Body element that contains call and response information</p></li><li><p>A Fault element containing errors and status information</p></li></ul><p>In order to use SOAP XML, you will need to customize the header of your POST or PUT request on your REST Connector.</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Set the HTTP Action to POST or PUT and Data As to XML.</p></li><li><p>Enter the Destination URL.<br/>You can test the example SOAP XML body we've provided below by using the Destination URL <a href="http://www.example.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.org</a></p></li><li><p>Click the &quot;Customize Headers&quot; link at the top of the connector<br/>Enter both a Name and a Value for SOAP XML :<br/>Name: <strong>Content-Type</strong><br/>Value: <strong>application/soap</strong>+<strong>xml</strong></p></li><li><p>Click the &quot;Customize Body&quot; link at the top of the connector<br/>Enter a customized body for the SOAP XML.
