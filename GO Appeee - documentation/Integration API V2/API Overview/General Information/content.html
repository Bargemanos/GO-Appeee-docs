<p>We provide an Application Programming Interface (API) for programmatic access to data hosted on the platform.<br/>This document outlines the API and is intended for software developers and systems integrators.</p><p>The API is exposed using web services in a REST approach, providing a flexible and simple set of interfaces that can be accessed from just about any programming language.</p><p>Our platform was built to integrate, thus robust two-way data transfer is supported on several of the various objects exposed.</p><p>All APIs support both JSON and raw XML formats.<br/><strong>NOTE:</strong> XML requests must have each tag element in alphabetical order.</p><p>To access the various APIs, you must use the generated Integration Passkey which can be found on your Provider configuration page of the website.<br/>Keep this Integration Passkey safe since it is the principal key used for keeping your data secure.</p><p>The base URL for all Cloud APIs is <a href="https://web.appeee.nl/api/v2" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>https://web.appeee.nl/api/v2</u></a></p><p>If you are running GO Appeee Server, then the API will be available from the installed Server website’s root URL with the “/api/v2” suffix.</p><h3 id="GeneralInformation-GeneralDataTypeNotes"><strong>General Data Type Notes</strong></h3><ul><li><p>If not explicitly stated, date values are expected to be formatted using ISO 8601 format:<br/><em>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SSZ</em><br/>Where time zone is UTC, time is in 24 hour values and the “T” and “Z” are delimiters.</p></li><li><p>All latitude and longitude data values are unprojected and use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">WGS84 ellipsoid</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="GeneralInformation-APIHTTPStatusCodes"><strong>API HTTP Status Codes</strong></h3><p>We don't use a lot of HTTP codes on our API, our error messages are generally included in the response body.</p><p>Generally speaking, successful API calls will return a 200 HTTP code.</p><p>If the API call has an error result, you will get one of:</p><p>400 Bad Request - this occurs when missing or invalid parameters are submitted in the request.<br/>405 Method Not Allowed - this occurs if the API endpoint you are attempting to call does not exist.<br/>401 Unauthorized - your integration key and/or company id is not valid<br/>All other errors are normally returned under a 500 Internal Server Error</p><p>As mentioned above, if you get one of the above HTTP error codes then more details of the error will be included in the response body.</p><p />
