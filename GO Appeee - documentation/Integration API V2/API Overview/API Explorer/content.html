<p>We have moved to provide the majority of our v2 API documentation through our <strong>API Explorer</strong>.</p><p>The Explorer allows you to browse each available endpoint and its supported HTTP verbs, view the model properties and even test out calls to the API right there in the API Explorer.</p><p>Simply put, it's an integrator's dream and we think it makes API integration projects that much easier to implement.</p><p>While the primary focus of the Explorer is on JSON format requests and responses, there are some areas where you can specify an XML response type to get an idea of what the API requires and responds with on the XML side too.</p><p>The API Explorer is a dynamic, living document of our API and is generated directly from our API code, thus allowing you to have confidence that what you see in the Explorer is exactly what is supported and available right now on the API.</p><p>Each available API endpoint is outlined in the Explorer, with <strong>Model</strong> and <strong>Model Schema</strong> tabs/links which reveal the structures involved in requests and responses.</p><p>The <strong>Model</strong> tab/option on each endpoint, in particular, provides detailed descriptions of the various field definitions and structure relationships.</p><p>As a rule, the <strong>/search</strong> endpoints on the main API entities provide the most amount of detail for the common structures of that entity.</p><p>e.g. <a href="https://web.appeee.nl/apiexplorer#!/task/getv2tasksearch" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>https://web.appeee.nl/apiexplorer#!/task/getv2tasksearch</u></a> provides detailed descriptions of our Task entity and its related structures when you click the <strong>Model</strong> option under that endpoint. </p><p>You can access the API Explorer right now on <a href="https://web.appeee.nl/apiexplorer" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"><u>https://web.appeee.nl/apiexplorer</u></a></p><p>To see which node you should access, simply look at the URL of your web browser when you are viewing the web portal.<br/>It differs in the first part of the URL i.e. secure or secure-eu or secure-au and just use the corresponding link.</p><p>If you are using a branded website, simply tack &quot;/apiexplorer&quot; onto your custom domain name to access it.</p><p />
