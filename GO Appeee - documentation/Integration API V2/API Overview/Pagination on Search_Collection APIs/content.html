<p>Depending on your organisation's usage profile, our API provides access to potentially large numbers of records. </p><p>Often you might be asking for too much information, and in order to keep our platform performing well, the API automatically paginates the requested items.</p><p>Pagination means that if the result of your request is a lot of items, we will only return a slice of this result at a time - we call each slice a <strong>page</strong>.</p><p>All our collection / search style APIs implement pagination, and as such you must cater for this when you connect to our platform.</p><h3 id="PaginationonSearch/CollectionAPIs-PaginationBasics"><strong>Pagination Basics</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Specify the page (i.e. the slice) of the result set you wish to receive by using the <strong>PageNo</strong> parameter found on all our collection/search APIs.<br/>By default, all paginated APIs start at PageNo of 0, which is the first page of the result set.<br/></p></li><li><p>Specify how many items to receive by using the <strong>PageSize</strong> parameter found on all our collection/search APIs.<br/>By default this is set to our default maximum of 100 items per request.<br/>There are a few exceptions on some of our higher volume APIs.  For example, our SList Search API has a default of 1000 items.<br/></p></li><li><p>All our paginated APIs return a <strong>TotalRows</strong> value in the response which tells you the total number of rows available for your request parameters.<br/>Using the PageSize you passed into your request, you can calculate how many pages of data you can request.<br/>i.e. PageSize / TotalRows = Total number of pages<br/></p></li><li><p>Once you know how many pages are available, you can make progressive API requests, iterating through the result set page by page.</p></li></ul>
